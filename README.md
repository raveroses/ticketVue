## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run VueTicket locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm installed.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raveroses/ticketVue.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ticket
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Environment Variables
This project currently uses client-side local storage for all data persistence and does not require server-side environment variables.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through your web browser.

1.  **Access the Application**: Open your browser and navigate to the address provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
2.  **Sign Up**: If you are a new user, click "Get Started" or navigate to `/signup` to register a new account by providing your full name, email, and password. Your credentials will be stored locally.
3.  **Login**: After signing up, or if you already have an account, navigate to `/login` to log in using your registered email and password.
4.  **Dashboard**: Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the dashboard. Here you can:
    *   View a summary of your tickets (Total, Open, Resolved).
    *   Use the sidebar to switch between "Create Ticket" and "Ticket List".
5.  **Create a Ticket**: Select "Create Ticket" from the sidebar. Fill in the title, description, and choose a status (Open, Close, In progress) for your new ticket, then click "Create."
6.  **Manage Tickets**: Select "Ticket List" from the sidebar to view all your created tickets. From here, you can:
    *   **Edit**: Click the "Edit" button next to a ticket to modify its details.
    *   **Delete**: Click the "Delete" button to remove a ticket permanently.

The hero section prominently features an image (`ticket.jpg`) that visually represents the ticket management concept, providing an engaging first impression of the application's purpose.
